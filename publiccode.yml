    shortDescription: jEAP microservice example demonstrating consumer-driven contract testing with Pact in a provider with segregated APIs.
    longDescription: >
      The jme-cdct-segregated-provider-example is a jEAP microservice that demonstrates consumer-driven contract 
      testing using Pact for a provider service exposing two distinct APIs. 
      The example includes automated verification tests that retrieve all relevant consumer contracts from a Pact Broker, 
      validate them against the provider's implementation, and publish the verification results back to the broker. 
      This ensures the provider fulfills all consumer expectations and maintains contract compliance across both APIs.
    features:
      - Run provider verification tests
      - Fetch pacts from a Pact Broker
      - Verify the provider implementation against the pacts
      - Publish verification results back to the Pact Broker
